# Test projects in Quartex Pascal

Some personal test projects to learn Quartex Pascal and understand how it works.

Quartex is an IDE to create web applications like we do programs in Delphi / Lazarus IDE. We have a form editor, and code in Pascal Language.

The IDE compile the Pacal in JavaScript and generate the HTML+JS page to start the application.

We have access to all JS libraries and API even if no wrapper is available in the given Pascal libraries (units).

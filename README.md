# Test projects in Quartex Pascal

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Some personal test projects to learn Quartex Pascal and understand how it works.

[Quartex Pascal IDE](https://quartexdeveloper.com) is an development environment to create web applications like we do programs in [Delphi](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi.html) or [Lazarus IDE](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/lazarus.html). We have a form editor, and code in [Pascal Language](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/pascal-objet.html).

The IDE compiles the Pascal in JavaScript and generate the HTML+JS page to start the application.

We have access to all JS libraries and API even if no wrapper is available in the given Pascal libraries (units).

Click to learn more about [Quartex Pascal IDE](https://quartexdeveloper.com) and look at [its genese](https://jonlennartaasenden.wordpress.com/category/qtx/).

Some videos are available in [Jon Aasenden YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CipherDiaz/search?query=quartex) and in [the website media section](https://quartexdeveloper.com/media-and-press/).

If you want to check my streams replays or posts about Quartex (in French), look at [this blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/quartex-pascal.html). My discovery stream, which was fairly random and lacked any basic knowledge, is available [on this page](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/decouverte-de-quartex-pascal-from-scratch.html), but it was really trial and error that led to the first two examples in this code repository.

In this code repository, you will find tests that I did while learning about the environment and the libraries it offers. It is a rather personal work repository. Nothing should really be useful to you unless you want to see the results of coding certain projects done in stream.

I have opened a [repository of my QTX sample projects](https://codeberg.org/PatrickPremartin/QuartexPascal-Samples) that will be more thoughtful and may be explained on the [Pascal Developer blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/) or the [Web Developer Tips blog](https://trucs-de-developpeur-web.fr/), since Quartex Pascal uses Object Pascal and JavaScript.

## Talks and conferences

## Compatibility

I'm a Quartex Pascal IDE license owner. I use latest version of this web developer tool and libraries.

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it.

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/test-projects-in-quartex-pascal/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.

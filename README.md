# Test projects in Quartex Pascal

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Some personal test projects to learn Quartex Pascal and understand how it works.

Quartex is an IDE to create web applications like we do programs in [Delphi](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi.html) / [Lazarus IDE](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/lazarus.html). We have a form editor, and code in [Pascal Language](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/pascal-objet.html).

The IDE compile the Pascal in JavaScript and generate the HTML+JS page to start the application.

We have access to all JS libraries and API even if no wrapper is available in the given Pascal libraries (units).

Click to learn more about [Quartex Pascal IDE](https://quartexdeveloper.com) and look at [its genese](https://jonlennartaasenden.wordpress.com/category/qtx/). You also can suppport the project and have access to builds and updates from [the Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/quartexnow/about).

A lot of demo videos are available in [Jon Aasenden YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CipherDiaz/search?query=quartex) and in [the website media section](https://quartexdeveloper.com/media-and-press/).

If you want to check my streams replays or posts about Quartex (in French), look at [this blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/quartex-pascal.html) or [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr). My discovery stream, which was fairly random and lacked any basic knowledge, is available [on this page](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/decouverte-de-quartex-pascal-from-scratch.html), but it was really trial and error that led to the first two examples in this code repository.
